# REFACTOR CODE

<p>For my coding bootcamp, my task was to use the starter code and refactor it. So with this webpage I made it more accesibles, added some comments for people to follow along and combined many elements to avoid so much going on at once on both the HTML & CSS pages. </p>

    HTML
    Replaced all div classes with sections & articles ID's & classes
    Added header link and navigation bar
    Replaced footer div with footer

    CSS
    Combined contents and benefits styling together
    Used footer, repalced footer div
