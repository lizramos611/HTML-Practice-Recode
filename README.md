  ## Description
For my coding bootcamp, my task was to use the starter code and refactor it. So with this webpage, I made it more accessible, added some comments for people to follow along and combined many elements to avoid so much going on at once on both the HTML & CSS pages. 


  ## Usage
  I plan on using this to show off my HTML skills and introductory skills for CSS. I have learned how to read and understand code enough to use semantic elements and simple styling.
  
    HTML
    Replaced all div classes with sections & articles ID's & classes
    Added header link and navigation bar
    Replaced footer div with footer

    CSS
    Combined contents and benefits styling together
    Used footer, repalced footer div
